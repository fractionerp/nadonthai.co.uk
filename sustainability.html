  <p>We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment and resources required for our business. <br>
  Some examples of the actions we have taken are shared on this page.</p>

  <h4 style="color: var(--primary-gold); margin-top: 30px;">Single Use Plastics</h4>
  <p>We have eliminated single use plastics such as plastic bags, plastic straws and plastic cutlery for take away orders. <br>
  Take away containers are all recyclable and we do not use any foam containers.</p>
  
  <h4 style="color: var(--primary-gold); margin-top: 30px;">Energy Suppliers</h4>
  <p>Where possible we will use green energy suppliers for our gas and electricity. We review suppliers every year and look for the best solution.</p>

  <h4 style="color: var(--primary-gold); margin-top: 30px;">Carbon Offsetting</h4>
  <p>In order to help minimise our overall effect from our carbon footprint, each restaurant subscribes to a carbon offset plan provided by <a href="https://carbonneutralbritain.org" target="_blank">carbonneutralbritain.org</a>.
  In 2022, our restaurants have subscribed to offset 25 tons each of CO2 per year.</p>

  <h4 style="color: var(--primary-gold); margin-top: 30px;">Ocean Clean Up</h4>
  <p>As many of our customers know, the North East and Thailand has many beautiful beaches. Being an issue close to our hearts, we are happy to pay a monthly subscription to <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/" target="_blank">theoceancleanup.com</a> to help clean up plastics in the ocean.</p>

  <h4 style="color: var(--primary-gold); margin-top: 30px;">Who Gives a Crap?</h4>
  <p>There is a shocking amount of disposable plastics used for toilet roll. After finding <a href="https://uk.whogivesacrap.org/" target="_blank">uk.whogivesacrap.org</a>, we had to commit to using their toilet rolls. Check out their website to see just how much impact they are having on something as simple as toilet rolls. You can order for your home too!</p>
